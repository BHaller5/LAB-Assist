both beginner and expert players in fighting games.

## Info
This readme will contain the basic information needed for the project.
I will continue to update the readme as the project grows, so if you 
see any new additions in the project, it will most likely be documented here.

## Basic Gamepad Tester
This gamepad tester was originally gotten from MDN to get used to using
JavaScript's gamepad API. I'll soon be customizing some of the HTML and
styling to better fit the project. The actual gamepadtest.js code is pretty 
simple, and doesn't really need too much explaination, despite its length.

## General Guidelines
These are things to keep in mind while we are programming:
* We will start by implementing our interface with ONE type of controller first. With Jeff's recommendation, we will start with an arcade stick as our first controller. This will help to make our code less confusing and packed.
* We will start by implementing our program for ONE game right away. I think either Street Fighter, Tekken, or Mortal Kombat would be a good game to begin with, as they are relatively simple.
* Stick to basics. Implement everything on a basic level at first, and slowly start to build more functionality into each component that gets created. Building up from a solid base means that there will be well commented code for the basic implementation of a component. As things get more complex, the comments from the basic implementation will help everyone else get accustomed to how a component works.
