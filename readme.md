## Info
This readme will contain the basic information needed for the project.
I will continue to update the readme as the project grows, so if you 
see any new additions in the project, it will most likely be documented here.

## Basic Gamepad Tester
This gamepad tester was originally gotten from MDN to get used to using
JavaScript's gamepad API. I'll soon be customizing some of the HTML and
styling to better fit the project. The actual gamepadtest.js code is pretty 
simple, and doesn't really need too much explaination, despite its length.

## Future Tasks
Future tasks that I will be working on:
* Swapping .buttons out with buttons that match the layout of the controller
* Maybe changing the visual representation of the joysticks
